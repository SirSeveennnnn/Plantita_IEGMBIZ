  idealClimateAndTemperature: "Venus flytraps like temperatures between 70\xB0F and
    95\xB0F, while some kinds can withstand 40\xB0F in the winter under cover. "
  watering: Never offer your plants anything straight from the faucet; it's usually
    overly acidic or may include excessive amounts of minerals. Alternatively, use
    distilled water or rely on rainfall.
  soil: The Venus flytrap grows best in poor, acidic soil that drains well yet remains
    moist. Steer clear of conventional potting soil, as some may include additional
    fertilizers.
  humidity: Keep the surroundings damp for the best Venus flytrap maintenance. Turn
    on a fan in the room where you store your Venus flytrap plants because proper
    air circulation is essential for their growth.
