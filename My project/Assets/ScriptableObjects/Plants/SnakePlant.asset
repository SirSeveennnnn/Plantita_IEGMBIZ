  idealClimateAndTemperature: "The ideal growing temperature range for snake plants
    is between 70\xB0F and 90\xB0F. Plants should not be near chilly drafts."
  watering: 'Once the soil is entirely dry, give your snake plant a thorough watering.
    In the winter, check the soil mix every two weeks or so; the plant may only require
    monthly watering. Water right away if you see that the leaves are dry and brittle.
    Remember that the easiest way to destroy a snake plant is to overwater it. The
    plant''s root system will rot if it receives excessive water or is left in the
    water. '
  soil: Snake plants are houseplants that do well in a loose, well-drained potting
    soil mixture. All-purpose cactus potting soil is an excellent option because
    they thrive in sandier soil. Steer clear of soil mixes with a lot of peat since
    they may hold too much water.
  humidity: "Frost will not harm them, yet extended exposure to temperatures below
    50\xB0F can cause the plant to die. Humidity levels in the typical home between
    thirty and fifty percent will be fine for them."
