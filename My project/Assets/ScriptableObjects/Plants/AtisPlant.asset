  idealClimateAndTemperature: 'Temperatures between 50 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit
    (10 and 30 degrees Celsius) are ideal for sugar apple tree growth. The sugar
    apple tree is a tropical tree, yet it can withstand mild cold. '
  watering: A mature tree has to be watered every 12 to 15 days on average. To promote
    vegetative development and blossoms on the newly sprouted branches, there must
    be sufficient moisture in the soil. Every two to four weeks during the tree's
    slow development phase and every three to five days throughout its flowering
    and fruit-setting phase are when it will need to be watered. Fruit is more susceptible
    than leaves to dryness, thus it is important to avoid water stress and maintain
    moist soil during this period.
  soil: It grows in a wide range of soils, from sandy, clay to loam, but the healthiest
    and the productive tree is grown in fertile, loose, deep, and neutral or slightly
    alkaline soil that is not sandy with good drainage and aeration.
  humidity: Humidity should be maintained above 60% especially during the flowering
    period.
