  idealClimateAndTemperature: Peanuts grow best at temperatures between 86 and 93
    degrees Fahrenheit. Damage to flowers could result from higher temperatures.
  watering: During the growing season, peanuts require around one inch of rain or
    irrigation every week. Watering is very important right after planting to promote
    germination and seedling establishment. It's also important to water again 60
    to 110 days later, once the pegs have penetrated the soil and are starting to
    fill with peanut clusters.
  soil: "The ideal soil conditions for peanut growth are loose, well-drained, sandy
    loam with a pH range of 6.0\u20136.5, which is slightly acidic. Steer clear of
    hard clay soil that drains poorly. Never plant peanuts in the same area that
    you have previously used to grow beans or peas."
  humidity: While the plants are growing, slightly humid circumstances are ideal,
    but before the harvest, a period of dry weather is required.
